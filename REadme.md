Pedagogical GOAP implementation
================

This is intended as a simple Unity implementation of some reasonable approximation
to Orkin's Goal-Oriented Action Planning from the game F.E.A.R. (Monolith 2005).

The planner code is in Assets/Planner and should be relatively easy to move to a different game.
The rest is just a kind of minimal set of NPCs that run around and try to shoot each other.  The
linkage to the planner is in Assets/Agent.cs.
